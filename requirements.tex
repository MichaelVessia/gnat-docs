\chapter{Introduction}

\section{Purpose}

General Network Access Tester is an Android application which helps IT departments, network administrators, or anyone that wants to monitor a network that they have access to. The application should be free to download on the Google Play store, and the application will be open source. The application provides information that will make it easier for someone to troubleshoot their network.  The application also reduces the workload on IT departments by allowing them to troubleshoot more quickly.

This document is meant to give an overview of the features of the General Network Access Tester, making the process of using the application for one's own network simple, and making contributing to the project easy and painless.

\section{Document Conventions}
The General Network Access Tester will hereafter be referred to as GNAT. Users will be someone that interacts with the mobile application.  An administrator will be the person who owns the network and is likely having the logs sent to them.  The administrator can and likely will also be the user.

\section{Intended Audience and Reading Suggestions}
This document is meant for administrators who would like to have their network monitored by GNAT, or developers who would like to make contributions to GNAT. It is not required that users read this document, but if they would like further clarification about the settings they they are configuring within the application, they will find that information in this document.  Developers will be interested in the source code. As of version \version, the source code can be found at \sourcecode.

\section{Project Scope}

GNAT is targetting network administrators who have a considerable amount of mobile devices connecting to their network, and would like more information about failed connections. It should reduce the time an IT team needs to troubleshoot why people are unable to connect to their network.

\chapter{Overall Description}

\section{Product Perspective}

GNAT should integrate well into an existing monitoring/dashboard system, but ultimately should be a stand-alone application and not depend on any other software.


\section{Product Functions}

Within the mobile application, users will be able to enter a number of configuration options.  The network connection that will be attempted will be based upon these configuration options.  The result of this connection attempt will be logged if anything goes wrong. Although the application tests network access, it ultimately assumes that the user has access to the internet.  If there is an initial connection error, logs will be stored locally until a connection is made, at which point it will send the logs via the specified means of communication.

The application needs both internet and GPS connection to generate the desired logs and send them to the specified location.  The GPS will allow the logs to contain relevant geographical information, like where the device was when it attempted to connect from.

If the administrator uses a dashboard service that has an API, GNAT will be able to send the logs via the API to be viewed in the dashboard service.
 
\section{User Classes and Characteristics}
The user of the application is expected to either be the administrator, or be a knowledgeable user that recieved the relevant information from the administator.  End users of the network should not have to interact with GNAT, but assuming they had the relevant information nothing would be stopping them.

\section{Operating Environment}
GNAT will run on the Android operating system.  The application will require the user to have at least Android 4.0.3 (Ice Cream Sandwich). It also assumes there is a network to be tested.

Outside of the application, the administrator should feel free to create an internet facing web page, and place a file on that page.  The app will attempt to connect to this web page, based on the address the user enters in the configuration. GNAT can simply check if the file was able to be downloaded, or the file can be a script that does something else.  

\section{Design and Implementation Constraints}

\begin{itemize*}
  \item GNAT will be accepting a network password as user input.  This should be handled appropriately.
  \item GNAT will be able to connect to a third-party dashboard monitoring service like Zenoss, it should handle these credentials correctly as well.
  \item GNAT will connect to the network using the HttpUrlConnection client, provided by the Android platform.
\end{itemize*}

\section{Assumptions and Dependencies}

\begin{itemize*}
  \item If a user plans to use a third party monitoring system, they need to make sure they are credentialed to do so and that the service provides an API.  If the service has not yet been used with GNAT, a user should feel free to add their functionality to GNAT, and create a pull request at \sourcecode.
  \item GNAT assumes the user knows the password to the network they are trying to test.  Failure to connect should be from other issues, not authentication.
\end{itemize*}

\chapter{External Interface Requirements}

\section{User Interfaces}

No UI as of \version.

\section{Hardware Interfaces}
$<$Describe the logical and physical characteristics of each interface between 
the software product and the hardware components of the system. This may include 
the supported device types, the nature of the data and control interactions 
between the software and the hardware, and communication protocols to be 
used.$>$

\section{Software Interfaces}
$<$Describe the connections between this product and other specific software 
components (name and version), including databases, operating systems, tools, 
libraries, and integrated commercial components. Identify the data items or 
messages coming into the system and going out and describe the purpose of each.  
Describe the services needed and the nature of communications. Refer to 
documents that describe detailed application programming interface protocols.  
Identify data that will be shared across software components. If the data 
sharing mechanism must be implemented in a specific way (for example, use of a 
global data area in a multitasking operating system), specify this as an 
implementation constraint.$>$

\section{Communications Interfaces}
$<$Describe the requirements associated with any communications functions 
required by this product, including e-mail, web browser, network server 
communications protocols, electronic forms, and so on. Define any pertinent 
message formatting. Identify any communication standards that will be used, such 
as FTP or HTTP. Specify any communication security or encryption issues, data 
transfer rates, and synchronization mechanisms.$>$


\chapter{System Features}
$<$This template illustrates organizing the functional requirements for the 
product by system features, the major services provided by the product. You may 
prefer to organize this section by use case, mode of operation, user class, 
object class, functional hierarchy, or combinations of these, whatever makes the 
most logical sense for your product.$>$

\section{System Feature 1}
$<$Don’t really say “System Feature 1.” State the feature name in just a few 
words.$>$

\subsection{Description and Priority}
$<$Provide a short description of the feature and indicate whether it is of 
High, Medium, or Low priority. You could also include specific priority 
component ratings, such as benefit, penalty, cost, and risk (each rated on a 
relative scale from a low of 1 to a high of 9).$>$

\subsection{Stimulus/Response Sequences}
$<$List the sequences of user actions and system responses that stimulate the 
behavior defined for this feature. These will correspond to the dialog elements 
associated with use cases.$>$

\subsection{Functional Requirements}

Temporary info to be revised: 

\subsubsection{Functional Requirement 1.1}

\section{System Feature 2 (and so on)}


\chapter{Other Nonfunctional Requirements}

\section{Security Requirements}
$<$Specify any requirements regarding security or privacy issues surrounding use 
of the product or protection of the data used or created by the product. Define 
any user identity authentication requirements. Refer to any external policies or 
regulations containing security issues that affect the product. Define any 
security or privacy certifications that must be satisfied.$>$

\section{Software Quality Attributes}
$<$Specify any additional quality characteristics for the product that will be 
important to either the customers or the developers. Some to consider are: 
adaptability, availability, correctness, flexibility, interoperability, 
maintainability, portability, reliability, reusability, robustness, testability, 
and usability. Write these to be specific, quantitative, and verifiable when 
possible. At the least, clarify the relative preferences for various attributes, 
such as ease of use over ease of learning.$>$

\section{Appendix A: Glossary}
\begin{itemize*}
    GNAT - General Network Access Tester
\end{itemize*}

\section{Appendix B: To Be Determined List}
$<$Collect a numbered list of the TBD (to be determined) references that remain 
in the SRS so they can be tracked to closure.$>$
